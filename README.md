# ML-DDoS-Detection-SGB
Machine Learning DDoS detection using stochastic Gradient Boosting compared with other Supervised ML algorithms.
the datasets used to evalute the ML models are uploded to Kaggle.
Find the datasets at https://www.kaggle.com/devendra416/ddos-datasets.

For the detailed process of extraction of dataset and discussion of results refer the paper "Machine Learning DDoS Detection Using Stochastic Gradient Boosting" at https://www.ijcseonline.org/pdf_paper_view.php?paper_id=4011&28-IJCSE-06600.pdf
